# Split-GPX-Trackfile

Garmin GPS devices have limits on the number of trackpoints per track, for example the Etrex30 can only handle 10,000 trackpoints.   This script will split a large .gpx file (say from ridewithgps.com) into sub-files containing only the number of trackpoints you specify.

You can find the limit of a particular device on the Internet, a good starting point is http://www.aukweb.net/services/lwg_1.htm


# Status

Currently only supporting gpx files.   Quite happy add support for .tcx tracks if there are requests.  Also happy to port to another language if Perl isn't available for you.

Also happy to write and maintain a website version, if someone wants to host this functionality.
